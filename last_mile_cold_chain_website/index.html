      <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
      <p>Vaccines lose potency outside the 2–8°C range. Remote regions lack reliable electricity which leads to cold chain failures and high wastage. Our solution focuses on affordability, portability, and durability.</p>

      <h2>Objectives</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Maintain temperature constantly (2–8°C)</li>
        <li>Operate independently of grid electricity</li>
        <li>Provide a reliable, sustainable vaccine storage</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>System Design (Summary)</h2>
      <p>The design uses solar panels, thermal energy storage (PCM packs), vacuum insulated box and an ESP32 for monitoring (Wi‑Fi/Bluetooth). See page images and diagram in the PDF for sketches and layout (refer to the system design on page 6 of the PDF).</p>
